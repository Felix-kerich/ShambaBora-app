### 1. 📋 Searchable Dropdowns

Instead of typing everything manually, farmers can now:
- **Search** through pre-populated lists of common items
- **Select** from suggested options
- **Type custom values** when needed (still flexible!)

#### Available Smart Dropdowns:

**For Expenses:**
- **Suppliers**: Local Agro-Dealer, Kenya Seed Company, Simlaw Seeds, NCPB, etc.
  - Type a few letters to search
  - Select from the list
  - Or enter a new supplier name

**For Activities:**
- **Fertilizers**: DAP, CAN, Urea, NPK variants, TSP, Manure, etc.
- **Maize Seeds**: DH04, H513, H614, H625, Pannar varieties, Pioneer 3253, etc.

**For Yield Records:**

4. OR type your own custom value
5. Press "Use" to add custom values not in the list

### 2. 📍 GPS Location Picker

2. Tap the GPS icon
3. Grant location permission (one time only)
4. Your current location will be automatically filled in
5. The app will try to get a readable address name
6. If unavailable, it shows GPS coordinates (Latitude, Longitude)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No typing required
- ✅ Accurate location tracking
- ✅ Easy to identify fields on maps
- ✅ Works offline (after getting location)
- ✅ Can still type location manually if preferred

**Available in:**
- Patch Creation (main field location)

### 3. 🎯 Context-Aware Suggestions

The app now **intelligently suggests** relevant options based on what you're doing:

#### Activity Type Detection:

**When recording PLANTING:**
- Shows maize seed varieties (DH04, H513, H625, etc.)
- Suggests planting-related descriptions

**When recording FERTILIZATION:**
- Shows fertilizer types (DAP, CAN, NPK, Urea, etc.)
